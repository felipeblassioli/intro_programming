# Programming Exercises

Write a program that:

  1. Prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, except the ones that are divisible by 3.
  2. [Finds the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
  3. [By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
  4. [Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)
  
     A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

  5. [Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

  6. Initializes a 100 element array to contain randomized integers between 1 and 100;  outputs the values in array order; sorts the array and outputs the resulting sorted values.

  7. A program that accepts a sorted array of numbers and a value to search and:
    - Performs a linear search and prints "FOUND at index = <index> with <count> elements tested" if the value exists in the array or "NOT FOUND"
    - Performs a binary search and prints "FOUND at index = <index> with <count> elements tested" if the values exists in the array or "NOT FOUND"
